# I'm not a mathematician nor computer scientist, I came to coding/programming from another route. 
# But these are my solutions to the problems I've encountered at Project Euler. At the moment, they are first attempts with the occasional bit of brute-forcing. 
# I hope to review these in the future as I gain insight and understanding of the (mathematical nature of the) problems.
# Mostly done in R, but occasionally using a bit of Python as some R packages don't seem to play nicely with Apple M hardware (or at least that is my assumption).
