These are my solutions to some of the coding/mathematical problems at Project Euler. I'm not a mathematician nor computer scientist, I came to coding/programming by another route but have been having fun solving these challenges. I came across Project Euler at the beginning of April 2024 and have since successfully found solutions to 35 of the problems, making me one of fewer than 8% of users to achieve that number of solutions. I've been solving the problems in R and Python.

Some of my first attempts have used a bit of brute-forcing. I look forward to reviewing these in the future as I gain insight and understanding of the (mathematical nature of the) problems and can make my solutions more elegant.

Project Euler allows the publishing of solutions for the first 100 problems.
